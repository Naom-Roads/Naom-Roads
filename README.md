### 💻 Past & Personal Projects
This account holds many of the projects from my early journey in web development — from full-stack movie apps to personal trackers and portfolio experiments.  
Some of these are older, but they reflect how I grew as a developer. You’ll find:
- `client-myflix` – JS client pulling data from a custom API  
- `finance-tracker` – Ruby project focused on budgeting logic  
- `developer-portfolio` – React-based showcase app  
*(Older repos are archived, but kept for transparency.)*

> 🔐 Most of my active code contributions now live in **private repositories** under the [TalkWiz.ai GitHub organization](https://github.com/naomsTalkwiz).
